            <p>
            Hi everyone! My name is Jessica Maya. I am a 26 years old and a mother of three. Based on the Myer Briggs personality test, I am an INTP. 
            I have been working as an IT Support Technician for 3 years now.
            Although I love being in I.T., I thought it was best to switch careers. My plan is to obtain 2 CIS AA degrees, then start a coding bootcamp. 
            I am hoping this class will help me with basic HTML knowledge, so I don't struggle too much in the bootcamp. My goal is to start off as a Front-End Developer. 
            From there, I may transition into another developer job. 
            </p>
